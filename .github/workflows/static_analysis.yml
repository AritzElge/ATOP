      # Rules suppression:
      # Ignore missing system headers as they are provided by the target toolchain (e.g., ARM GCC)
      # Library functions are not called within the library itself; entry points are in the app layer
      # Prevent CI failure when a specific suppression is not triggered in the current file set
      # DEVIATION: Required for Dependency Injection to support SITL/HITL simulation (Ref: CODING_STANDARDS.md)
      # Temp_DEVIATION: 8.9. Is annoying during development of the interfaces. MUST BE REMOVED THIS DEVIATION LATER
      # Temp_DEVIATION: 2.3: As its PoC yet, using more globally available NOW it's okay. MUST BE REMOVED THIS DEVIATION LATER
      # Support C99 features (e.g., inline, fixed-width types) required for modern MCU development
